# Projet-Data-Mining


For the "Antoine" branch, I imported my python code allowing to convert ordinal values into quantitative valeus. For this, you simply need to download the python code "Modification_CSV.py" and put in the same directory the csv folder "Road Accident Data.csv".

N.B. The CSV file used is the one with Nicolas' modifications. That is to say, a new column "Time_Cat" has been added next to the column "Time" in order to classify the hours of the day into categories.

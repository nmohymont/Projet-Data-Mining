# Projet-Data-Mining

To use this code, we just need to have the file 'Road Accident Data.csv' and 'correspondance region et police_force.csv'.

When launching the code, a 'Append_Time_cat_Road_Accident_Data.csv' file will be created with the changes.

The modifications are as follows:
- Sort modalities of certain variables (elimination of exceptional values abérantes)
- Transformations of ordinal variables into numerical variables (creation of new columns for them)
- Creation of new categories (EX: the hour and classified according to the time of day morning/afternoon/evening) 
- Box plot creation for information purposes
